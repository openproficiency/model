# Open Proficiency Model

The Open Proficiency Model (OPM) is an open definition for quantifying an individual's familiarity with skills, capabilities, and other abilities.

Definitions include:

- [Experience Topic](specs/experience-topic.md) - a defined unique area of knowledge for gaining experience and becoming proficient.
- [Proficiency Score](specs/proficiency-score.md) - a number indicating the degree of understanding for a specific topic.
- [Experience Source](specs/experience-source.md) - activities a user can complete to increase proficiency in topics. (Tutorials, projects, normal work, etc.)
- [Topic List](specs/topic-list.md) - A list of topics provided by an issuer.
- [Transcript Entry](specs/transcript-entry.md) - proficiency score for a single topic.

## Advantages

- **Verified** - All proficiency is signed by the issuer.
- **Distributed** - All transcript records are independent of the issuer and learning source.
- **Never Repeat** - Knowledge topics and proficiency are transferrable. New courses on the same topics don't invalidate old courses.
